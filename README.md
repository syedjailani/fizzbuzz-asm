# fizzbuzz-asm

Stepping into the world of assembly language, I created a small application called [Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz). This led me to learn the following concepts

- How to do system calls
- Usage of various process registers and their purpose
- Importing functions from external object files
- Basic conditions
- Assembly Language Compilation

## How to compile

I have personally used Netwide assembler (NASM) on Ubuntu O/S.

To complie, in the project folder use the following command
```
Make all
```
